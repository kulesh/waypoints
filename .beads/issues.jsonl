It likely doesn't properly handle:\n1. Parent waypoints that have children (should execute children, not parent)\n2. The flat vs hierarchical waypoint list structure\n\n## Investigation Needed\n1. How does `flight_plan.waypoints` list represent parent/child relationships?\n2. Does `_select_next_waypoint()` check for children before selecting a parent?\n3.
