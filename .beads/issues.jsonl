{"id":"waypoints-v8r","title":"Multi-hop waypoints skipped during execution","description":"## Bug\nExecution skips multi-hop waypoints (parents with children) and moves to the next top-level waypoint.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Have a flight plan with WP-003 containing children (WP-003a, WP-003b, etc.)\n2. Complete WP-001 and WP-002\n3. Execution should start WP-003's children (WP-003a first)\n4. Instead, execution skips to WP-004\n\n## Root Cause (suspected)\n`_select_next_waypoint()` in fly.py iterates through `flight_plan.waypoints` looking for PENDING waypoints with met dependencies. It likely doesn't properly handle:\n1. Parent waypoints that have children (should execute children, not parent)\n2. The flat vs hierarchical waypoint list structure\n\n## Investigation Needed\n1. How does `flight_plan.waypoints` list represent parent/child relationships?\n2. Does `_select_next_waypoint()` check for children before selecting a parent?\n3. Should parent waypoints ever be directly executed, or only their children?\n\n## Files to Check\n- `src/waypoints/tui/screens/fly.py` - `_select_next_waypoint()`\n- `src/waypoints/models/flight_plan.py` - waypoint list structure","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-08T10:16:48.995024-05:00","created_by":"kulesh","updated_at":"2026-01-08T10:19:34.913994-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T10:19:34.913994-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed in commit 9d08487"}
